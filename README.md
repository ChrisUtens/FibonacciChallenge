# FibonacciChallenge
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued termsy

I didn't go for the most minimalistic solution, since i like seeing the arrays be filled with the Fibonacci sequence.

When solving the Fibonacci Challenge I used Sigmatek LASAL CLASS 2 to code and the Sigmatek Runtime system (LARS) to run my code.
For more info see: https://www.sigmatek-automation.com/en/products/engineering-tool-lasal/lasal-class/
Sigmatek software is license free, installers can be obtained via www.sigmacontrol.eu.

1) Install Sigmatek Lasal Class 2 DVE by installing "Lasal Class, Screen, MachineManager and Libs 0095_2.exe"
2) Install Sigmatek Lasal Runtime System (Lars by installing "Lars_0032_0.exe".
3) Start LARS and open the project in Lasal Class 2 and download it to "IP Lars Local". (see attached FibonacciChallegeNetwork.png)
4) The solution (4613732) can be seen in the object FibChallenge1 in the server SumOfArray. 


Since it might be a challenge to use and run an unknown DVE and Runtime System, i added some screenshots of the running code and a text file "RAW Code.txt". ;)
